So ....
I wanted to create a demo for a long time.
and I wanted to do it from scratch,
in a new language - Rust.

I told myself - get one little effect.
Get a little sync going,
and just finish the demo.

When it comes to eliteness of the Demo,
this is a prime example of something to be 
ashamed of.

The effect could probably run on a c64
or Amiga. 

It is huge in size.
etc.

but for this project - 
and the motto of the NoCMP group
it is all about creating 
and not comparing yourself with others

Create, Ship, Improve
No Compare!

Vame out!
